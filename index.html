<h1> Welcome to my Website!</h1>

<h2> Here you will get to learn a little bit about me!! </h2>

<p> My name is Julia Weiler, and I am a sophomore at UW Madison. During my free time, I love hanging out with my friends and family. When I'm not busy doing homework, I am a huge TV watcher. One of my most favorite activities is binging new shows on Netflix or Hulu. Currently, I am watching one of the most popular, binge worthy series on Netflix, The Vampire Diaries. On my website, I will give you some information on my all time favorite shows! If you would like to learn more about the show, The Vampire Diaries, you can click here: <a href= "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1405406" target="_blank">https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1405406/</a></p>
