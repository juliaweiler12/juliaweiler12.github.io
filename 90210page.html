<h2> My #3 All Time Favorite Show </h2>

<p> 90210 is a drama filled TV show that was based off of an old version of 90210. In 2008, they created a remake of this series, with a different cast and more modern plot. The show is filled with comedy, romance, and definitley a lot of drama. I loved this show and could watch it over and over again.</p>
