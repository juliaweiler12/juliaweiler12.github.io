<h1> One Tree Hill</h1>

<h2> My #2 All Time Favorite TV Show </h2>

<p>One Tree Hill is another amazing TV show I binged on Netflix. It has a cast of very relatable characters, that kept me smiling, laughing, and sometimes even crying. This is one of those shows I could re-watch a million times and just never get sick of. Personally, I think that everyone would love this show, no matter what age you are! </p>
