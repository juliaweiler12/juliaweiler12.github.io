<h1> Gossip Girl</h1>

<h2> My #1 All Time Favorite TV Show </h2>

<p> In 7th Grade, I watched Gossip Girl for the first time. It was the first show I ever binged on Netflix, and I was immediatley captivated by the first episode. The cast, plot, and setting of the entire show is amazing, and I would recommend this show to absolutley everyone.
